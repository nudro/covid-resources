# Tools <a name="tools"/>
Search Engines, Tools<pr>
 1. **DISCOVER COVID** - https://discovid.ai/search | In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), which contains over 57,000 scholarly articles about COVID-19 and related coronaviruses. In a call to action, the world's artificial intelligence experts have been asked to develop text and data mining tools that can help the medical community keep up with the rapid increase in literature. So, that’s what we did! Our search engine assists researchers to easily browse through the latest literature, explore related articles and thus helps to discover new avenues for research. We apply a machine learning approach called topic modeling, that helps us discover underlying topics in the whole set of publications. Each paper can then be seen as a mixture of these topics. This allows us to find related papers with a similar topic-mixture (Daniel Wolffram). <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-NEW-yellow"></img>

49. **COVID-19 LITERATURE CLUSTERING** Given the large number of literature and the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is difficult for health professionals to keep up with new information on the virus. Can clustering similar research articles together simplify the search for related publications? How can the content of the clusters be qualified? By using clustering for labelling in combination with dimensionality reduction for visualization, the collection of literature can be represented by a scatter plot. On this plot, publications of highly similar topic will share a label and will be plotted near each other. In order, to find meaning in the clusters, topic modelling will be performed to find the keywords of each cluster.

# Epi Models Code <a name="epi"/>

1. **COVID-19 Growth Rate Prediction**- https://covid19dashboards.com/growth-bayes/ - We assume a negative binomial likelihood as we are dealing with count data. A Poisson could also be used but the negative binomial allows us to also model the variance separately to give more flexibility. | Thomas Wiecki, @HamelHusain <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-withcode-red"></img> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/code-colab-yellow"></img> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/library-py-9cf"></img>

3. **NobBS: Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing** - https://github.com/sarahhbellum/NobBS - NobBS is Bayesian approach to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases from incomplete, time-stamped reporting data for disease outbreaks. NobBS learns the reporting delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve to produce smoothed nowcasts in both stable and time-varying case reporting settings. | sarahhbellum <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-withcode-red"></img> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/library-R-blue"></img>
4. **Scenario analysis for the transmission of COVID-19 in Georgia** - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/stochastic-GA.html - The epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States is poorly understood. To better understand the potential range of epidemic outcomes in the state of Georgia, we developed a model based on data from Hubei Province, China calibrated to regionally specific conditions in Georgia and observations of the number of reported cases in Georgia in early March. Github - https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ncov-wuhan-stochastic-model | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-withcode-red"></img>

6. **Spatial Spread of 2019 novel coronavirus in China** - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/spatial-china.html  - We developed a gravity-based model to better understand the risk of spatial spread of the 2019-nCov at the prefecture level in China, and to determine the efficacy of quarantines imposed in Wuhan and other prefectures. Github (private) - https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/CoronavirusSpatial | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
7. **Effect of early intervention on outbreak size of COVID-19 in China** - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/early-intervention.html - The epidemic of COVID-19 reached different areas of China at different times. This means that different locations were at different phases of outbreak at the time of the Wuhan lockdown (23 January) and other provincial and national actions. This provides what is sometimes called a “natural experiment” becuase it is as if replicate epidemics had been induced and then intervened on at different times. By looking at the effect of timing on outbreak size, we can draw conclusions about the effect of delaying intervention, which may be informative to other countries that are considering taking action. Github - https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ncov-early-intervention | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
8. **Effect of mass testing** - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/mass_testing.html - A symptom-based mass screening and testing intervention (MSTI) can identify a large fraction of infected individuals during an infectious disease outbreak. China is currently using this strategy for the COVID-19 outbreak. However, MSTI might lead to increased transmission if not properly implemented. We investigate under which conditions MSTI is beneficial.

11. **Speed of Spread of COVID-19** - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/speed-of-spread.html By US State and Global - Epidemics of COVID-19 are occuring at different times across the United States so it is important to compare the spread of an epidemic in a given state with the appropriate stage in other countries. The following figures show the cumulative number of cases in a state by number of days since the 100th case, number of days since the 1st case, and by calendar date, respectively.

12. **COVID-19 in Context** - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/context.html - How does the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic compare in severity to other recent disease outbreaks? We gathered data from existing studies to put COVID-19 into context. Github (private) https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ncov-context | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
13. **Estimating $R_0$ and other parameters for the 2019-nCov epidemic** -The epidemiology of the global 2019-nCov is poorly understood. Identifying the key processes that shape transmission and estimating the relevant model parameters is therefore an important task. This document presents arguments and analysis to support the estimation of a number of key quantities - Epidemic curve, Basic reproduction number ($R_0$), Case detection rate (q), Incubation period ($\frac{1}{\sigma}$), Lag between symptom onset and isolation, Transmissibility ($\beta$), Additional parameters; http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/parameters-supplement.html | The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia

15. **COVID-19 Growth Rate Prediction** - http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/stochastic.html - We developed a stochastic model to better understand the transmission of 2019-nCov in Hubei (primarily Wuhan). The model includes several features of the Wuhan outbreak that are absent from most compartmental models that otherwise confound the interpretation of data, including time-varying rates of case detection, patient isolation, and case notification.

Some of them are based on the classical epidemiological approach that assumes an exponential growth, but a few studies report that a power-law scaling may provide a better fitting to the currently available data. Hereby, we examine the epidemic data in China mainland (01/20/2020–02/24/2020) in a log-log scale, and indeed find that the growth closely follows a power-law kinetics over a significantly wide time period. <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-paper-brightgreen"></img>

The cumulative data can be fit to an empirical form obtained from a Susceptible-InfectedRemoved (SIR) model studied on an Euclidean network previously. Plotting the number of cases against the distance from the epicenter for both China and Italy, we find an approximate power law variation with an exponent ∼ 1.85 showing strongly that the spatial dependence plays a key role, a factor included in the model. <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-paper-brightgreen"></img>

This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas.<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-paper-brightgreen"></img>
 23.   **A time series method to analyze incidence pattern and estimate reproduction number of COVID-19 S Deb, M Majumdar - arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.10655, 2020** - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10655.pdf- In this study, we propose a time series model to analyze the trend pattern of the incidence of COVID-19 outbreak. We also incorporate information on total or partial lockdown, wherever available, into the model. The model is concise in structure, and using appropriate diagnostic measures, we showed that a time-dependent quadratic trend successfully captures the incidence pattern of the disease. We also estimate the basic reproduction number across different countries, and find that it is consistent except for the United States of America. <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-paper-brightgreen"></img>
 24.   **Early in the epidemic: impact of preprints on global discourse about COVID-19 transmissibility MS Majumder, KD Mandl - The Lancet Global Health, 2020**- https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30113-3/fulltext Since it was first reported by WHO in Jan 5, 2020, over 80 000 cases of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been diagnosed in China, with exportation events to nearly 90 countries, as of March 6, 2020.1 Given the novelty of the causative pathogen (named SARS-CoV-2), scientists have rushed to fill epidemiological, virological, and clinical knowledge gaps—resulting in over 50 new studies about the virus between January 10 and January 30 alone.2 However, in an era where the immediacy of information has become an expectation of decision makers and the general public alike, many of these studies have been shared first in the form of preprint papers—before peer review. <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-paper-brightgreen"></img>
 25.   **Eliminating COVID-19: A Community-based Analysis AF Siegenfeld, Y Bar-Yam - arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.10086, 2020** - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10086.pdf We analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering the transmission of the disease among individuals both within and between communities. A set of communities can be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact within each community far exceeds that between them (e.g. the U.S. could be partitioned by state or commuting zone boundaries). COVID-19 can be eliminated if the community-to-community reproductive number—i.e. the expected/average number off other communities to which a single infected community will transmit the virus—is reduced to less than one. We find that this community-to-community reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between communities and exponential in the length of the time-delay before communitylevel action is taken. <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-paper-brightgreen"></img>
 26.   **MAPPING THE LANDSCAPE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS AGAINST COVID-19** COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, with over 294,000 cases as of March 22, 2020 (WHO, 2020). In this review, we present an overview of recent studies using Machine Learning and, more broadly, Artificial Intelligence, to tackle many aspects of the COVID-19 crisis at different scales including molecular, medical and epidemiological applications.

We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0% (95% credible interval: 2.6-3.4%) in Hubei province and 3.3% (2.0-4.7%) in northern Italy. <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-paper-brightgreen"></img>
